# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System Using Matrix Factorization 🍿

## 🌟 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Movie Recommendation System** using **Matrix Factorization** in Python. Matrix factorization is a popular technique in collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems. By decomposing the user-item interaction matrix, we can uncover **latent features** that help predict user preferences more accurately. 🎥✨

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- 🔢 **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix manipulations.
- 📊 **Pandas**: For data loading, preprocessing, and analysis.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **MovieLens dataset**, which is widely used for building and evaluating recommender systems. Specifically, we use the **small dataset** variant, which contains ratings from **600 users** on **9,000 movies**. 🎞️

## 🔍 Understanding Matrix Factorization
Matrix factorization is a **mathematical technique** used to decompose a matrix into a product of multiple matrices. It is widely applied in recommendation systems to extract latent features from user-item interactions. 🧩

### ❓ Why Use Matrix Factorization?
✅ Reduces dimensionality of data while preserving essential features.  
✅ Helps in making predictions for unseen interactions by identifying latent factors.  
✅ Efficient for large-scale recommendation systems.  

### 🔎 How It Works
Given a user-item rating matrix **R**, matrix factorization decomposes it into two lower-dimensional matrices:
- 👤 **User feature matrix (U)**: Represents latent features of users.
- 🎬 **Item feature matrix (V)**: Represents latent features of movies.

The interaction between these two matrices approximates the original rating matrix. 📈
